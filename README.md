Absolutely! Here's a polished and professional `README.md` file tailored for your GitHub repository. It highlights the purpose, features, and usage of your **String Calculator TDD Kata** in JavaScript:

# 📏 String Calculator TDD Kata (JavaScript)

This repository contains an implementation of the **String Calculator TDD Kata**, inspired by [Roy Osherove’s TDD Kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1).  
It is designed to help developers practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles by incrementally building up functionality through small, testable steps.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

The goal of this kata is to reinforce TDD habits by starting with the simplest possible implementation and gradually expanding functionality based on failing tests.  
Each feature is added only when a test demands it, encouraging clean design and thoughtful refactoring.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- **Empty string returns 0**
  ```js
  add("") === 0
  ```
- **Single number returns itself**
  ```js
  add("1") === 1
  ```
- **Two comma-separated numbers return their sum**
  ```js
  add("1,2") === 3
  ```

### 🔢 Extended Support
- **Any amount of comma-separated numbers**
  ```js
  add("1,2,3,4,5") === 15
  ```
- **Newlines as valid delimiters**
  ```js
  add("1\n2,3") === 6
  ```

### ✂️ Custom Delimiters
- **Single-character custom delimiter**
  ```js
  add("//;\n1;2") === 3
  ```

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- **Negative numbers throw an exception**
  ```js
  add("1,-2,3,-5")
  // Error: "negatives not allowed: -2,-5"
  ```

### 🚫 Ignoring Large Numbers
- **Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored**
  ```js
  add("2,1001") === 2
  ```

### 🧩 Advanced Delimiters
- **Delimiters of any length**
  ```js
  add("//[***]\n1***2***3") === 6
  ```
- **Multiple single-character delimiters**
  ```js
  add("//[*][%]\n1*2%3") === 6
  ```
- **Multiple delimiters of length > 1**
  ```js
  add("//[**][%%]\n1**2%%3") === 6
  ```
